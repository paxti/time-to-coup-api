# Install & Run

## Prerequisites 

You need active MongoDB server available to run or test the application locally.

## Add .env file 

`MONGO_DB_CONNECTION=mongodb://localhost:27017/myproject`
`MONGO_DB_TEST_CONNECTION=mongodb://localhost:27017/myproject_test`
`PORT=8080`

Run `npm install` to install all packages and `npm run dev` to start app with hot reload. App has live reload using `nodemon`.

Run `npm run build && npm run start` to use production version.
Run `npm run test` for testing.

# CI pipeline

[GCP Cloud Build](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/) used to build test and deploy an app to the GCP App Engine. Take a look at `cloudbuild.yaml` and `app.yaml` for more information. To be able to deploy app successfully to `Cloud Build` you would need to encrypt .env file with prod values using [kms](https://cloud.google.com/kms/) an commit it to the repository. Also, you need to update keyName and keyRing in `cloudbuid.yaml` more information [here](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/encrypt-decrypt)
